# SciDAVis - Installation Notes

**Please visit our [homepage](http://scidavis.sourceforge.net) for more information.**

##Â Generic requirements
In order to compile SciDAVis, you need to install the following
libraries. Easiest is to use your package manager to install prebuilt versions.
- Qt version 5
- Qwt version 5
- QwtPlot3D
- GSL
- muParser
- zlib

For the optional Python scripting feature, you also need:
- Python version 3
- PyQt
- sip

For the default build, you also often need the QtAssistant package. If
not available, you can compile without (see below)

## Linux

1. In the top level directory, run qmake:

- qmake<br>
  Configures the minimal build
- qmake CONFIG+=python CONFIG+=liborigin<br>
  Configure python scripting and Origin import support
- qmake CONFIG+=noassistant<br>
  compile without QtAssistant (documentation browser)
- qmake CONFIG+=aegis<br>
  Build everything, including unit tests

2. type "make qmake" Take careful note of any warning/error messages at this
stage, as it may indicate installation problems that will cause
problems later.

3. type "make"

4. To install, type "make INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local

## Windows - MXE builds

The distributed windows .msi is built using MXE, a cross compiler
environment creating Windows esecutables on Linux

1. Clone MXE respository. Use highperformancecoders fork, as it
contains needed packages not in the official mxe fork
   - git clone https://github.com/highperformancecoder/mxe.git

2. Install necessary libraries:
   - cd mxe
   - `make MXE_TARGETS=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static boost gsl muparser qt5`
   - Note: currently python support is unavailable with MXE.
   - Note 2: The mesa library uses scons, which uses python and the xml library. You may need to install the python-xml package to get this to work.

3. Configure scidavis for MXE. If the location of your MXE dist is
MXE_HOME, do
   - $MXE_HOME/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32.static-qmake-qt5 CONFIG+=mxe

4. Build scidavis
   - make qmake
   - make
   - sip generated code incorrectly attempts to assign a nullptr to an integer field. Change it to 0.

5. Copy the scidavis directory to a Windows machine

6. Install [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org/)

7. Install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)

8. Create the install shield from scidavis top level directory
   - start cygwin bash shell
   - cd scidavis
   - sh makeMsi.sh

9. Do a test from the command prompt with
   - msiexec -i scidavis-XXX.msi

## Windows - old installation notes for historical reference

1.  Download the "Qt/Windows Open Source Edition" from [http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads/opensource/appdev/windows-cpp](http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads/opensource/appdev/windows-cpp). It comes with a graphical installer. When the Qt installer asks you to install MinGW, say yes unless you already have it on your system. In that case you have to tell the Qt installer where to find it. In the case that PyQt (see blow) does not yet support the latest version of Qt, you can get older versions here: [ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/](ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/).
2.  Download Python from [http://www.python.org/download/](http://www.python.org/download/) and install it.
3.  Download the source code of SciDAVis from [http://scidavis.sourceforge.net/download.html](http://scidavis.sourceforge.net/download.html) and unpack it.
4.  Download the SIP source code for Windows from [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download) and unpack it into the 3rdparty subfolder of the SciDAVis package. Rename the "sip-x.y" directory that gets created to "sip".
5.  Download the PyQt v4 source code for Windows from [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download) and unpack it into the 3rdparty subfolder of the SciDAVis package. Rename the "PyQt-win-gpl-x.y.z" directory that gets created to "PyQt-win-gpl".
6.  Download the "Developer files" of the GSL from [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm) and unpack them into the 3rdparty subfolder of the SciDAVis package.
7.  Download the source code of the latest version of Qwt from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13693](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13693) and unpack it into the 3rdparty subfolder of the SciDAVis package. Rename the "qwt-x.y.z" directory that gets created to "qwt".
8.  Download the source code of QwtPlot3D from [http://qwtplot3d.sourceforge.net/web/navigation/download_frame.html](http://qwtplot3d.sourceforge.net/web/navigation/download_frame.html) and unpack it into the 3rdparty subfolder of the SciDAVis package.
9.  Download the source code of muParser from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137191](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137191) and unpack it into the 3rdparty subfolder of the SciDAVis package. Rename the "muparser_vxyz" directory that gets created to "muparser".
10.  Open the start menu, find the folder created by the Qt SDK and start a "Qt Command Prompt". Execute "cd <directory containing SciDAVis sources>", then "build". SciDAVis and its dependencies should be built automatically and installed into the directory "output".

## Mac OS X - MacPorts instructions

These notes refer to use MacPorts. Using other build environments such
as HomeBrew is presumably equally as viable, but you may need to hack
the config files a bit.

1. Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).

2. Install [XCode and XCode command line
tools](https://guide.macports.org/#installing.xcode)

3. If you want to be able to run your build on an earlier version of
MacOSX than your build machine, see [How to build a Macintosh
executable that will run on older versions of
MacOSX.](http://www.hpcoders.com.au/blog/?p=100)

4. Install the prerequisites for scidavis.
  - port install qt4-mac qwt52 qwtplot3d boost gsl py27-pyqt4 py-pyqwt py27-sip muparser<br>
  Sadly, you may need to do this step multiple times before eveything
  is installed

4. link sip-2.7 share directory to where sip expects it to be:
~~~
ln -sf /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/share/sip /opt/local/share/py27-sip
~~~

5. Add qt's bin directory to your PATH
  - PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/libexec/qt4/bin:$PATH
  
6. Configure scidavis
  - qmake CONFIG+=osx_dist
  
7. Build scidavis
  - make qmake
  - make

8. Create the installable package
  - sh mkMacDist.sh

### License:

Thus it is ["free software"](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html). "Free software" is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech", not as in "free beer". "Free software" is also often called [Open Source, FOSS, or FLOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software). When we say that SciDAVis is "free", we are talking about

*   The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
*   The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
*   The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
*   The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

That said, SciDAVis is also free as in "free beer". We do not charge money for anything you can download on our homepage and we will not do so in the future. See [here](http://scidavis.sourceforge.net/contributing/index.html) for why we can do this and why we're working on SciDAVis.
