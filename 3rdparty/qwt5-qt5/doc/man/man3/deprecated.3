.IP "\fBMember \fBQwtPlot::clear\fP ()\fP" 1c
Use QwtPlotDeict::detachItems instead  
.IP "\fBClass \fBQwtPlotPrintFilter\fP \fP" 1c
In Qwt 5\&.0 the design of \fBQwtPlot\fP allows/recommends writing individual QwtPlotItems, that are not known to \fBQwtPlotPrintFilter\fP\&. So this concept is outdated and \fBQwtPlotPrintFilter\fP will be removed/replaced in Qwt 6\&.x\&.
